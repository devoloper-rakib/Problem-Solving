<!-- *  Write a javaScript program that takes an array which contains all unique integer elements and a peak element. Find the index of the peak element from the array. If the peak element does not exist, return -1. -->
<!-- Note: You have to use binary search algorithm

Example:
input:
array=[5,6,8,9,11,22,36,98]
Peak element= 11
Output: 4 -->

<!-- * Create a function that reverses an array -->

<!-- * Sort an array from lowest to highest -->

<!-- * Remove the spaces found in a string -->

<!-- * Return the number of vowels in a string. -->

<!-- * Calculate the sum of numbers within an array -->
